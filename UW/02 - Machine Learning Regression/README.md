This is the repo in which I post my learning journey in Machine Learning: Regression course, provided by University of Washington.

# Learning Journey
- Describe the input and output of a regression model.
- Compare and contrast bias and variance when modeling data.
- Estimate model parameters using optimization algorithms.
- Tune parameters with cross validation.
- Analyze the performance of the model.
- Describe the notion of sparsity and how LASSO leads to sparse solutions.
- Deploy methods to select between models.
- Exploit the model to form predictions. 
- Build a regression model to predict prices using a housing dataset.
- Implement these techniques in Python.
